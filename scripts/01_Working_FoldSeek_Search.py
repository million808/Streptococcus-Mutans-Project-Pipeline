# Purpose: This script is part of a larger pipeline to reduce the Foldseek search space from ~200 million structures down to a filtered list
# of uncharacterized proteins. It retrieves structure alignments from the Foldseek web API, scans across all major Foldseek-supported databases,
# extracts hits labeled as "uncharacterized protein", and saves them to a file ready for downstream processing with ActSeek.

import json           # I use this to process any API responses returned as JSON.
